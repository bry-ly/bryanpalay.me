# Building Modern Portfolio Websites with Next.js

In this post, I'll share my approach to building modern portfolio websites using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for portfolio websites:

- **Server-Side Rendering** - Great for SEO and initial load performance
- **Static Generation** - Perfect for content that doesn't change frequently
- **Image Optimization** - Built-in next/image component
- **API Routes** - Easy backend functionality without a separate server

## Key Features to Include

### 1. Responsive Design

Your portfolio should look great on all devices. Use Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities to achieve this effortlessly.

### 2. Dark Mode Support

Modern portfolios should support both light and dark themes. The `next-themes` library makes this straightforward.

### 3. Smooth Animations

Subtle animations enhance user experience. Libraries like Framer Motion or the native Motion library work great with React.

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Optimize images using next/image
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio is a great way to learn new technologies while creating something useful. Start simple and iterate based on feedback!
